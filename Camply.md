# CAMPLY

## Camply-web

- Connected to Supabase for PostgreSQL database
- Created a login system via Google authentication with Supabase integration
- Implemented an academic form section where new users must complete onboarding to provide basic details about themselves and their academic life
  - Several colleges are currently available for users to select during testing
  - College data is manually added and users simply select their college
  - Users can only enter the main app after completing this section

### Current Features

**Sidebar Implementation**

- Currently used only for the desk section (home and campus sidebars will be built later)
- Available in both white and dark themes
- Sidebar includes a footer with user profile, name, and email that functions as a button for profile, settings, and logout options
- Logout functionality works with a confirmation dialog

**Desk Sidebar Structure**

- Contains two main sections: Profile and Semester
- Profile section includes Campus and Academics components

- Features a Camply AI bot connected to the backend as a bridge with ADK, which will be used for future agent connections in the app

**Profile/Campus Component**

- Campus component displays basic college details
- Includes prompt buttons connected to the backend for generating responses
- Button prompts in the campus-content section should open dedicated pages
- These pages should display responses as clear, well-formatted markdown
- Pages should professionally render markdown responses for optimal readability
- Generated responses should be saved and not updated on every click;cached for one day

**Academic Component Development**

- Display comprehensive user academic data
- Show academic timeline for each semester
- Implement department/branch handbook collection system:
  - Store handbooks in Supabase
  - Create 10-20 columns to store JSON data extracted from handbooks
  - Each column should contain specific departmental data (basics, exams, evaluations, semesters, attendance, etc.)
  - Develop agent or backend functionality to analyze/parse handbooks using Python parsing libraries
  - Store collected handbook data in Supabase for ADK response generation
- Enable users to ask questions about their rulebook specialized handbook query component
